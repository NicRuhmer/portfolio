            Back in 2020, I took the plunge into coding during my Computer Science studies, captivated by the process of
            transforming ideas into
            <span class="text-accent2">high-performance, accessible web applications</span>. Fast-forward to today,
            and I've been fortunate to work on diverse international projects, collaborating with cross-functional teams
            to create
            <span class="text-accent2">robust, user-focused digital experiences</span> that prioritize usability and
            impact.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content text-base/relaxed">
            My main focus is on <span class="text-accent2">performance optimization</span> and <span
                class="text-accent2">web accessibility</span> — ensuring that every product not only looks polished
            but also <span class="text-accent2">functions seamlessly</span> under the hood. I thrive in bridging the
            gap between design and engineering, crafting software that meets both aesthetic and technical standards.
            Leading and mentoring teams has become a key part of my role, helping us collectively push the boundaries of
            what we can build.
        </p>
        <p class="text-content text-base/relaxed">
            Outside of coding, I’m always on the lookout for new ways to <span class="text-accent2">challenge
                myself</span> and learn. Whether it’s
            hitting the <span class="text-accent2">basketball court</span> for some friendly competition, getting
            immersed in a <span class="text-accent2">thought-provoking book</span>, or setting out to <span
                class="text-accent2">conquer a new trail</span>, I love experiences that keep me <span
                class="text-accent2">curious</span> and
            <span class="text-accent2">motivated</span>. Spending time with friends is also a huge part of my life —
            nothing beats a great conversation or
            shared adventure. These moments help me recharge and bring fresh perspectives back to my <span
                class="text-accent2">work</span>.
